## Project Goals
This project will collect learning resources for the information security industry. This information will be presented in human-readable format as Markdown and will also be programmatically accessable via JSON files. This will allow the use and format of this data in many ways.

Contained in this project will also be various scripts. For example, converting the JSON files into various human-readable formats, or a command line tool that walks a user through creating a new entry.
